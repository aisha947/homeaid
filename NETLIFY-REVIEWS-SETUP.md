# Netlify Reviews System Setup

This guide explains how the Netlify-compatible reviews system works for your HomeAid website.

## How It Works

This system uses a combination of:

1. **Local Storage** - To immediately display new reviews to all visitors
2. **Netlify Forms** - To collect review submissions in your Netlify dashboard
3. **JSON File** - For initial/default reviews

When a user submits a review:
- The review is saved to their browser's local storage
- The review is immediately displayed in the testimonial slider
- The review is submitted to Netlify Forms for your records
- The review will persist for that user across page refreshes

## No Setup Required!

The best part is that **no setup is required**! The system works automatically with Netlify.

## How Reviews Are Displayed

1. **Initial Reviews** - Loaded from `reviews.json` file
2. **New Reviews** - Saved to local storage and displayed immediately
3. **All Reviews** - Displayed in sequence with 10-second timing

## Benefits

- **✅ WORKS ON NETLIFY** - Compatible with static hosting
- **✅ NO SETUP REQUIRED** - Works out of the box
- **✅ IMMEDIATE DISPLAY** - Reviews appear instantly
- **✅ FORM SUBMISSIONS** - All reviews are sent to Netlify Forms
- **✅ PERSISTENT** - Reviews persist across page refreshes

## Accessing Submitted Reviews

You can access all submitted reviews in your Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Click on "Forms" in the top navigation
3. You'll see all form submissions, including reviews

## Important Notes

- Reviews are stored in the user's browser local storage
- This means reviews submitted by one user will be visible to that user on future visits
- Other users will see their own submitted reviews plus the default ones
- If you want to make a review permanent for all users, add it to the `reviews.json` file
