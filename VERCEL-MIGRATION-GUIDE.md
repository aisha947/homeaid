# Migrate from Netlify to Vercel - Complete Guide

## Why Vercel is Better for Your Reviews System

✅ **Built-in database** (Vercel KV) - completely free  
✅ **Serverless functions** included  
✅ **Auto-deploy** from GitHub like Netlify  
✅ **Reviews work automatically** - zero manual work  
✅ **Better performance** - faster loading  
✅ **100% free** for your use case  

## Step 1: Create Vercel Account (2 minutes)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign up" 
3. Choose "Continue with GitHub"
4. Authorize Vercel to access your repositories

## Step 2: Deploy Your Site to Vercel (3 minutes)

1. In Vercel dashboard, click "New Project"
2. Select your `homeaid` repository
3. Click "Deploy"
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
5. Your site is now live on Vercel!

## Step 3: Enable Vercel KV Database (2 minutes)

1. In your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to **Storage** tab
3. Click "Create Database"
4. Choose **KV (Redis)**
5. Name it: `homeaid-reviews`
6. Click "Create"
7. Click "Connect to Project"

## Step 4: Add New Files to Your Repository

Add these files to your GitHub repository:

### 4.1 Create `vercel.json` (configuration file)
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/reviews.js": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/reviews",
      "destination": "/api/reviews.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.2 Create `api/reviews.js` (backend function)
- Copy the content from the file I created above
- This handles storing/retrieving reviews from the database

### 4.3 Create `package.json` (dependencies)
```json
{
  "name": "homeaid-reviews",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@vercel/kv": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Update Your HTML

In your `index.html`, replace the review scripts:

**Remove:**
```html
<script src="simple-reviews.js"></script>
<script src="debug-reviews.js"></script>
<!-- Remove all other review scripts -->
```

**Add:**
```html
<script src="vercel-reviews.js"></script>
```

## Step 6: Deploy Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Migrate to Vercel with automatic reviews"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy your site!

## Step 7: Test Everything

1. Visit your new Vercel URL
2. Check that reviews display properly
3. Click "Share Your Experience"
4. Submit a test review
5. **Review should appear immediately!**

## Step 8: Update Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain:
1. In Vercel dashboard → **Domains**
2. Add your domain
3. Update DNS records as shown
4. Your domain will work with Vercel

## What You Get with Vercel

✅ **No manual work** - completely automated  
✅ **Free database** - Vercel KV included  
✅ **Better performance** - faster than Netlify
